# Part 4 - Field of view

In this part we will be implementing "Field of View". We'll need to calculate all the cells our @ can see and keep track of those that have already been discovered. Through this common mechanic we get the thrill of exploration!

Before we can get to do that, we have a couple of outstanding tasks to take care of.

Have you noticed how the floor renders on top of our @? That's because our game has no concept of layers and our tiles have no backgrounds. Let's take care of both of those right now.

Let's add backgrounds to our tiles first. In `./src/lib/canvas.js` add two additional functions:

```javascript
const drawBackground = ({ color, position }) => {
  if (color === "transparent") return;

  ctx.fillStyle = color;

  ctx.fillRect(
    position.x * cellWidth,
    position.y * cellHeight,
    cellWidth,
    cellHeight
  );
};

export const drawCell = (entity, options = {}) => {
  const char = options.char || entity.appearance.char;
  const background = options.background || entity.appearance.background;
  const color = options.color || entity.appearance.color;
  const position = entity.position;

  drawBackground({ color: background, position });
  drawChar({ char, color, position });
};
```

Instead of calling `drawChar` directly we can now call `drawCell` and pass it any entity with an appearance and a position component. Our new `drawCell` function calls `drawBackground` and `drawChar` for us. We can still get a transparent background if we need to by passing the color 'transparent'. We also have an options object for overrides if needed.

No just replace `drawChar` in `./src/systems/render.js` with `drawCell` and pass the entity in directly.

```diff
import world from "../state/ecs";
import { Appearance, Position } from "../state/components";
-import { clearCanvas, drawChar } from "../lib/canvas";
+import { clearCanvas, drawCell } from "../lib/canvas";

const renderableEntities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance],
});

export const render = () => {
  clearCanvas();

  renderableEntities.get().forEach((entity) => {
-    const { appearance, position } = entity;
-    const { char, color } = appearance;
-
-    drawChar({ char, color, position });
+    drawCell(entity);
  });
};
```

And add a default background to our Appearance component in `./src/state/components`

```diff
export class Appearance extends Component {
  static properties = {
    color: "#ff0077",
    char: "?",
+    background: "#000",
  };
}
```

Ahhhh... I feel so much better - that's been bugging me for a while now :)

Check out the game to make sure its running smooth... and our @ has gone missing.

Html canvas draws pixels where you tell it, when you tell it. We just happen to be telling it to draw our @ before we tell it to the floor - so it draws our @ and then draws the floor directly on top. We could try and reorder our entities but that would be a huge pain to keep track of. Let's do it with a couple new components instead.

Add these components to `./src/state/components.js`

```javascript
export class Layer100 extends Component {}

export class Layer300 extends Component {}

export class Layer400 extends Component {}
```

And register them in `./src/state/ecs.js`

```diff
import { Engine } from "geotic";
import {
  Appearance,
  IsBlocking,
+  Layer100,
+  Layer300,
+  Layer400,
  Move,
  Position,
} from "./components";

const ecs = new Engine();

// all Components must be `registered` by the engine
ecs.registerComponent(Appearance);
ecs.registerComponent(IsBlocking);
+ecs.registerComponent(Layer100);
+ecs.registerComponent(Layer300);
+ecs.registerComponent(Layer400);
ecs.registerComponent(Move);
ecs.registerComponent(Position);

export const player = world.createEntity();
player.add(Appearance, { char: "@", color: "#fff" });
player.add(Position);

export default world;
```

I like to number my layers in hundreds just in case I need to squeeze something in between. 100 is for the ground, 300 for things on the ground like items, and 400 is for the player.

Next we need to add the layer components to all our entities so we now where to render what. First in `./src/lib/dungeon.js` import the `Layer100` component and add it to the floors and walls.

```diff
import {
  Appearance,
  IsBlocking,
+  Layer100,
  Position,
} from "../state/components";
```

```diff
if (tile.sprite === "WALL") {
  const entity = world.createEntity();
  entity.add(Appearance, { char: "#", color: "#AAA" });
  entity.add(IsBlocking);
+  entity.add(Layer100);
  entity.add(Position, dungeon.tiles[key]);
}

if (tile.sprite === "FLOOR") {
  const entity = world.createEntity();
  entity.add(Appearance, { char: "â€¢", color: "#555" });
+  entity.add(Layer100);
  entity.add(Position, dungeon.tiles[key]);
}
```

And then in `./src/state/ecs.js` we need to add `Layer400` to our player entity.

```diff
export const player = world.createEntity();
player.add(Appearance, { char: "@", color: "#fff" });
+player.add(Layer400);
player.add(Position);

export default world;
```

Almost there! We need to query for each layer component so we can render everything in the correct order.

Make `./src/systems/render.js` look like this:

```javascript
import world from "../state/ecs";
import {
  Appearance,
  Position,
  Layer100,
  Layer300,
  Layer400,
} from "../state/components";
import { clearCanvas, drawCell } from "../lib/canvas";

const layer100Entities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer100],
});

const layer300Entities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer300],
});

const layer400Entities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer400],
});

export const render = () => {
  clearCanvas();

  layer100Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    drawCell(entity);
  });

  layer300Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    drawCell(entity);
  });

  layer400Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    drawCell(entity);
  });
};
```

We've removed the `renderableEntities` query in favor of queries for each layer. Then we simply render each layer in order.

Our @ has returned to the dungeon and the floor properly is beneath it's feet!

Nice work! We're starting to build a solid foundation for our game. We just have one more thing before we can add our "Field of View". Remember in the last tutorial where I talked about how we weren't going to add an `entitiesAtLocation` cache? I lied. We're totally going to add one. Right now.

First let's add a new file to store our cache with a few helper functions for accessing it. Create a file in `./src/state` called `cache.js` at `./src/state/cache.js` and make it look like this:

```javascript
export const cache = {
  entitiesAtLocation: {},
};

export const addCacheSet = (name, key, value) => {
  if (cache[name][key]) {
    cache[name][key].add(value);
  } else {
    cache[name][key] = new Set();
    cache[name][key].add(value);
  }
};

export const deleteCacheSet = (name, key, value) => {
  if (cache[name][key] && cache[name][key].has(value)) {
    cache[name][key].delete(value);
  }
};

export const readCacheSet = (name, key, value) => {
  if (cache[name][key]) {
    if (value) {
      return cache[name][key].get(value);
    }

    return cache[name][key];
  }
};

export default cache;
```

We just set up an object to store our cache and create some helper functions for basic CRUD operations. Our entitiesAtLocation cache will be an object with locId keys. LocIds are just a stringified combination of the location x and y properties (e.g, '0,1'). The value at each key will be a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) of entity ids. A Set has some advantages over an array in this case. Specifically we have a get method for simple access of values and it's super fast.

The purpose of this cache is to track what entities are in each location. So to start we should add entities to the cache when they get the `Position` component. Geotic provides some lifecycle methods that can help with this. In our components file at `./src/state/components.js` we can add entities to the cache when the Position component is attached to an entity!

```diff
import { Component } from "geotic";
+import { addCacheSet } from "./cache";
```

```diff
export class Position extends Component {
  static properties = { x: 0, y: 0 };

+  onAttached() {
+    const locId = `${this.entity.position.x},${this.entity.position.y}`;
+    addCacheSet("entitiesAtLocation", locId, this.entity.id);
+  }
}
```

Next we need to update our cache when an entity moves. The simplest way for us to do this right now is in our movement system at `./src/systems/movement.js`. After all the checks to determine if an entity is able to move and right before we update their position, we can update the cache like this:

```diff
import world from "../state/ecs";
+import { addCacheSet, deleteCacheSet, readCacheSet } from "../state/cache";
import { grid } from "../lib/canvas";
import { Move } from "../state/components";
```

```diff
if (blockers.length) {
  entity.remove(entity.move);
  return;
}

+deleteCacheSet(
+  "entitiesAtLocation",
+  `${entity.position.x},${entity.position.y}`,
+  entity.id
+);
+addCacheSet("entitiesAtLocation", `${mx},${my}`, entity.id);

entity.position.x = mx;
entity.position.y = my;
```

We simply delete the entity id at it's previous location in cache and then add it to the new one.

Ok, now that our cache is all set up, let's use it! Still in `./src/systems/movement.js` replace the current check for blockers:

```javascript
// check for blockers
const blockers = [];
for (const e of world._entities) {
  if (e[1].position.x === mx && e[1].position.y === my && e[1].isBlocking) {
    blockers.push(e);
  }
}
if (blockers.length) {
  entity.remove(entity.move);
  return;
}
```

With the new one that uses our cache:

```javascript
const blockers = [];
// read from cache
const entitiesAtLoc = readCacheSet("entitiesAtLocation", `${mx},${my}`);

for (const eId of entitiesAtLoc) {
  if (world.getEntity(eId).isBlocking) {
    blockers.push(eId);
  }
}
if (blockers.length) {
  entity.remove(entity.move);
  return;
}
```

The biggest change here is that we now only check the entities at our intended location if they are blocking. Previously we checked the location of every entity in the entire game to determine if it was both blocking AND in the place we wanted to go. We're going to need this information quite a bit moving forward so it makes sense to just rip off the band aid and implement the cache.

---

We are all caught up and ready to add "Field of Vision"! We are going to be using my javascript implementation of an FOV algorithm I found online by Bob Nystrom (Munificent). He wrote the online roguelike [Hauberk](https://munificent.github.io/hauberk/) and a fantastic book called [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/). I'll be honest and say I don't remember exactly how this algorithm works. Hooking it up is the important bit for our purposes. If you want to understand it fully, there is an exhaustive [blog post about it here](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/09/07/what-the-hero-sees/) where Bob explains far better than I could.

Ok, first let's go ahead and add a new file called `fov.js` to our lib directory at `./src/lib/fov.js`. Go ahead and paste this code into it:

```javascript
import { distance, idToCell } from "./grid";

const octantTransforms = [
  { xx: 1, xy: 0, yx: 0, yy: 1 },
  { xx: 1, xy: 0, yx: 0, yy: -1 },
  { xx: -1, xy: 0, yx: 0, yy: 1 },
  { xx: -1, xy: 0, yx: 0, yy: -1 },
  { xx: 0, xy: 1, yx: 1, yy: 0 },
  { xx: 0, xy: 1, yx: -1, yy: 0 },
  { xx: 0, xy: -1, yx: 1, yy: 0 },
  { xx: 0, xy: -1, yx: -1, yy: 0 },
];

// width: width of map (or visible map?)
// height: height of map (or visible map?)
export default function createFOV(
  opaqueEntities,
  width,
  height,
  originX,
  originY,
  radius
) {
  const visible = new Set();

  const blockingLocations = new Set();
  opaqueEntities
    .get()
    .forEach((x) => blockingLocations.add(`${x.position.x},${x.position.y}`));

  const isOpaque = (x, y) => {
    const locId = `${x},${y}`;
    return !!blockingLocations.has(locId);
  };
  const reveal = (x, y) => {
    return visible.add(`${x},${y}`);
  };

  function castShadows(originX, originY, row, start, end, transform, radius) {
    let newStart = 0;
    if (start < end) return;

    let blocked = false;

    for (let distance = row; distance < radius && !blocked; distance++) {
      let deltaY = -distance;
      for (let deltaX = -distance; deltaX <= 0; deltaX++) {
        let currentX = originX + deltaX * transform.xx + deltaY * transform.xy;
        let currentY = originY + deltaX * transform.yx + deltaY * transform.yy;

        let leftSlope = (deltaX - 0.5) / (deltaY + 0.5);
        let rightSlope = (deltaX + 0.5) / (deltaY - 0.5);

        if (
          !(
            currentX >= 0 &&
            currentY >= 0 &&
            currentX < width &&
            currentY < height
          ) ||
          start < rightSlope
        ) {
          continue;
        } else if (end > leftSlope) {
          break;
        }

        if (Math.sqrt(deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY) <= radius) {
          reveal(currentX, currentY);
        }

        if (blocked) {
          if (isOpaque(currentX, currentY)) {
            newStart = rightSlope;
            continue;
          } else {
            blocked = false;
            start = newStart;
          }
        } else {
          if (isOpaque(currentX, currentY) && distance < radius) {
            blocked = true;
            castShadows(
              originX,
              originY,
              distance + 1,
              start,
              leftSlope,
              transform,
              radius
            );
            newStart = rightSlope;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  reveal(originX, originY);
  for (let octant of octantTransforms) {
    castShadows(originX, originY, 1, 1, 0, octant, radius);
  }

  return {
    fov: visible,
    distance: [...visible].reduce((acc, val) => {
      const cell = idToCell(val);
      acc[val] = distance({ x: originX, y: originY }, { x: cell.x, y: cell.y });
      return acc;
    }, {}),
  };
}
```

Now that we have our Field of Vision algorithm in place we need to wire it up. We'll start with the system this time. Create a new file, again called `fov.js` but this time in the systems directory at `./src/systems/fov.js`. It should look like this:

```javascript
import { readCacheSet } from "../state/cache";
import world, { player } from "../state/ecs";
import { grid } from "../lib/canvas";
import createFOV from "../lib/fov";
import { IsInFov, IsOpaque, IsRevealed } from "../state/components";

const inFovEntities = world.createQuery({
  all: [IsInFov],
});

const opaqueEntities = world.createQuery({
  all: [IsOpaque],
});

export const fov = () => {
  const { width, height } = grid;

  const originX = player.position.x;
  const originY = player.position.y;

  const FOV = createFOV(opaqueEntities, width, height, originX, originY, 10);

  // clear out stale fov
  inFovEntities.get().forEach((x) => x.remove(x.isInFov));

  FOV.fov.forEach((locId) => {
    const entitiesAtLoc = readCacheSet("entitiesAtLocation", locId);

    if (entitiesAtLoc) {
      entitiesAtLoc.forEach((eId) => {
        const entity = world.getEntity(eId);
        entity.add(IsInFov);

        if (!entity.has(IsRevealed)) {
          entity.add(IsRevealed);
        }
      });
    }
  });
};
```

You may have noticed some new components we imported at the top - we'll create those next. But let's go over what this system is doing first. The first thing it does is gather some data to pass into `createFOV`. The last argument passing into createFOV is the visual range of our hero and the only one you may want to manually tweak.

```javascript
export const fov = () => {
  const { width, height } = grid;

  const originX = player.position.x;
  const originY = player.position.y;

  const FOV = createFOV(opaqueEntities, width, height, originX, originY, 10);
```

Next the system removes the component `IsInFov` from all entities that previously had it. This clears out all the state from the last turn ensuring that we always have the latest data.

The algorithm returns an array of locations within our hero's field of view. We need to find all the entities at each location and add an `IsInFov` component. If an entity has never been revealed we will add an `IsRevealed` component as well. This is why we created a cache earlier. Having to iterate through every entity in the game for every tile in FOV every turn... ugh. That would be bad.

```javascript
  // clear out stale fov
  inFovEntities.get().forEach((x) => x.remove(x.isInFov));

  FOV.fov.forEach((locId) => {
    const entitiesAtLoc = readCacheSet("entitiesAtLocation", locId);

    if (entitiesAtLoc) {
      entitiesAtLoc.forEach((eId) => {
        const entity = world.getEntity(eId);
        entity.add(IsInFov);

        if (!entity.has(IsRevealed)) {
          entity.add(IsRevealed);
        }
      });
    }
  });
};
```

We should probably create those components we're referencing. In `./src/state/components.js` add the following:

```javascript
export class IsInFov extends Component {}

export class IsOpaque extends Component {}

export class IsRevealed extends Component {}
```

And register them in `./src/state/ecs.js`

```diff
import {
  Appearance,
  IsBlocking,
+  IsInFov,
+  IsOpaque,
+  IsRevealed,
  Layer100,
  Layer400,
  Move,
  Position,
} from "./components";

const ecs = new Engine();

// all Components must be `registered` by the engine
ecs.registerComponent(Appearance);
ecs.registerComponent(IsBlocking);
+ecs.registerComponent(IsInFov);
+ecs.registerComponent(IsOpaque);
+ecs.registerComponent(IsRevealed);
ecs.registerComponent(Layer100);
ecs.registerComponent(Layer400);
ecs.registerComponent(Move);
ecs.registerComponent(Position);
```

The fov algorithm needs to know what locations on the map are see through and what aren't. The `IsOpaque` component is the flag we're using to determine that. Let's add it to walls in `./src/lib/dungeon.js` now.

```diff
import {
  Appearance,
  IsBlocking,
+  IsOpaque,
  Layer100,
  Position,
} from "../state/components";
```

```diff
if (tile.sprite === "WALL") {
  const entity = world.createEntity();
  entity.add(Appearance, { char: "#", color: "#AAA" });
  entity.add(IsBlocking);
+  entity.add(IsOpaque);
  entity.add(Layer100);
  entity.add(Position, dungeon.tiles[key]);
}
```

We're getting close - we need to call our new fov system on each turn in `./src/index.js`. While we're in this file let's do quick refactor - rather than directly mutate player position to set the starting point let's just add the `Position` component in this file. This way we are no longer breaking a core tenant of ECS - don't mutate entity props directly outside of a system - and we ensure that our player's position will be correctly cached because we are adding the Position component with the correct x and y.

Go ahead and make these changes:

```diff
import "./lib/canvas.js";
import { grid } from "./lib/canvas";
import { createDungeon } from "./lib/dungeon";
+import { fov } from "./systems/fov";
import { movement } from "./systems/movement";
import { render } from "./systems/render";
import { player } from "./state/ecs";
-import { Move } from "./state/components";
+import { Move, Position } from "./state/components";

// init game map and player position
const dungeon = createDungeon({
  x: grid.map.x,
  y: grid.map.y,
  width: grid.map.width,
  height: grid.map.height,
});
-player.position.x = dungeon.rooms[0].center.x;
-player.position.y = dungeon.rooms[0].center.y;
+player.add(Position, {
+  x: dungeon.rooms[0].center.x,
+  y: dungeon.rooms[0].center.y,
+});

+fov();
render();

let userInput = null;

document.addEventListener("keydown", (ev) => {
  userInput = ev.key;
  processUserInput();
});

const processUserInput = () => {
  if (userInput === "ArrowUp") {
    player.add(Move, { x: 0, y: -1 });
  }
  if (userInput === "ArrowRight") {
    player.add(Move, { x: 1, y: 0 });
  }
  if (userInput === "ArrowDown") {
    player.add(Move, { x: 0, y: 1 });
  }
  if (userInput === "ArrowLeft") {
    player.add(Move, { x: -1, y: 0 });
  }

  movement();
+ fov();
  render();
};
```

Now that we're adding the Position component in index.js we can delete the line where we were doing it in `./src/state/ecs.js`:

```diff
export const player = world.createEntity();
player.add(Appearance, { char: "@", color: "#fff" });
-player.add(Position);
player.add(Layer400);
```

We're on the home stretch! We just need a couple more edits to our render system. The queries need to know about `IsInFov` and `IsRevealed`. We will use another property in the queries, `any`. The any property will exclude any entity that does not have at least one of the specified components. So we now require that entities have all of `[Position, Appearance, Layer100]` and at least one of `[IsInFov, IsRevealed]`

In `./src/systems/render.js` make the following changes:

```diff
import world from "../state/ecs";
import {
  Appearance,
+  IsInFov,
+  IsRevealed,
  Position,
  Layer100,
  Layer300,
```

```diff
const layer100Entities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer100],
+  any: [IsInFov, IsRevealed],
});

const layer300Entities = world.createQuery({
  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer300],
+  any: [IsInFov, IsRevealed],
});

const layer400Entities = world.createQuery({
-  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer400],
+  all: [Position, Appearance, Layer400, IsInFov],
});
```

Layer400 requires all entities have `IsInFov`. This layer will have monsters - and we only want monster locations to be revealed if they are actually in view.

Go ahead and take a look at the game - cool huh? We could stop there but let's make one more improvement. Let's change the color of entities that have been revealed but are no longer FOV. We will use the options override in drawCell to do that. Go ahead and make the render function look like this:

```javascript
export const render = () => {
  clearCanvas();

  layer100Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    if (entity.isInFov) {
      drawCell(entity);
    } else {
      drawCell(entity, { color: "#333" });
    }
  });

  layer300Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    if (entity.isInFov) {
      drawCell(entity);
    } else {
      drawCell(entity, { color: "#333" });
    }
  });

  layer400Entities.get().forEach((entity) => {
    if (entity.isInFov) {
      drawCell(entity);
    } else {
      drawCell(entity, { color: "#100" });
    }
  });
};
```

Very nice! Now the difference between tiles in our field of vision and those that we know about but can't currently see is obvious.

---

Wow, one more done!

In part 4 we refactored our draw function to support backgrounds, introduced layers, and built a basic cache, all before implementing a major new feature - Field of Vision! You should be very proud of yourself for making it this far - the game is shaping up! Commit everything to github and deploy!

In the [part 5](https://github.com/luetkemj/jsrlt/blob/master/tutorial/part5.md) we get to finally add some goblins and kick 'em around! See you there :)
