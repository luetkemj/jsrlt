## Foreword

The original rewrite was done by [@luetkemj](https://github.com/luetkemj).
He made parts 0 to 11.
Geotic v4 was recently released and parts weren't working as shown in the original.
I went ahead and updated all the parts to Geotic v4.

After that, I decided to continue where he left of and finished part 12 and 13.

Thank you so much [@luetkemj](https://github.com/luetkemj) for doing this rewrite.
Additional shout out to [@ddmills](https://github.com/ddmills). He gave me some feedback regarding the upgrade process.
